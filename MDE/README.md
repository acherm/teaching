# Model-driven Engineering (IDM/MDE) 

This is an old repository with MDE content related to courses given at University of Rennes 1. 
The content is not deprecated -- students can pick some solutions of lab sessions. 

Specific repositories are now used as part of the MDE course (e.g., each year a new repo).
