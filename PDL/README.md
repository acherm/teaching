# Projet de DÃ©veloppement Logiciel

Various projects have been proposed and implemented since 2013 (simulation cars, chess analysis, 3D printing, opencompare, etc.)
The goal is to lead a non-trivial project with a focus on software aspects (Java/Web) and customers' requirements. 

There is no content in this repository (slides are available here: http://www.mathieuacher.com/teaching/PDL/) but you can find many online repositories related to PDL (e.g., in Github).
